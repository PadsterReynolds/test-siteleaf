        <p class="bigtfont editable">meem services are supported by three retail stores and nine &lsquo;nano-stores&rsquo;, which together create a unique retail experience for its clientele.&nbsp;<br /><br />These futuristic customer stores are all touch-screen with virtually no paper work required, unless otherwise required by regulation. It is a complete departure from the traditional banking branch. By eliminating the costs associated with large physical branch networks, meem generates significant savings, which are passed on to customers via higher rates of return for deposits and lower service charges.</p>
