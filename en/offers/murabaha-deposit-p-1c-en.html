Following your issue of a ‘Customer’s Acceptance of the Supplier’s Offer’ and your payment of the Purchase Price to the Supplier, a Purchase Transaction shall occur and the Supplier shall issue a ‘Confirmation of Sale to the Customer’.  \n\n1.3\tYour sale to us: Following your ownership of the Commodity, we shall issue an ‘Offer to Purchase the Commodity’ from you on deferred payment terms at the Deferred Sale Price. Upon your issue of the ‘Customer’s Acceptance of Bank’s Offer’, a Sale Transaction shall occur and we will issue a ‘Confirmation of Purchase’.  \n\n1.4\tWe will maintain an account in your name in respect of the Murabaha Deposit into which the Deferred Sale Price will be paid."
  - conditions-text: "2.\tRENEWAL OF MURABAHA DEPOSIT\n2.1\tIn relation to each Deferred Sale Price, you issue a Wakala and appoint us as your agent to re-invest the entire Deferred Sale Price or only the Purchase Price (as the case may be) for the same period as the existing Sale Transaction at the then prevailing rates offered by us for Murabaha Deposits in a new Sale Transaction in accordance with the murabaha process approved by our Shariah Supervisory Board.  \n\n2.2\tIn performing our obligations under the Wakala, we shall be acting on your behalf and shall take all measures which are reasonably necessary in good faith in order to protect your rights and interests. We shall not be liable for any loss, damage, costs or expenses, suffered or incurred by you as a result of anything done or omitted to be done (as the case may be) by us in the course of performing our obligations, unless such loss, damage, costs or expense arises directly as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n2.3\tYou shall indemnify us on first demand against all losses, claims, actions, proceedings, damage, costs and expenses whatsoever brought or claimed by any party and/or incurred or sustained by us as a result of our acting as your agent. Your indemnity to us shall survive termination of these Terms and any sums payable under it shall not be subject to any deduction whether by way of set off counter claim or otherwise."
  - conditions-text: "3.\tREQUEST FOR EARLY PAYMENT \n3.1\tYou may, at any time, but only once during the term of a Murabaha Deposit, request the payment of the applicable Deferred Sale Price before the Deferred Payment Date. However, in accordance with the principles of Islamic Shariah, we shall not be under any obligation to prepay.  \n\n3.2\tUpon receiving such a request, we may elect, to prepay any amount, or decline to do so. In any event, notify you of our decision within ten (10) Business Days of receiving your request.  \n\n3.3\tIn the event we elect to make a prepayment, we shall: \n(a)\tpay you up to 20% of the Purchase Price.  You will not receive any profit on this prepaid amount but you will continue to earn the profit on the remaining amount and you will receive such remaining amount and the profit thereon on the Deferred Payment Date; or \n(b)\tpay you only 100% of the Purchase Price but you will not receive any profit and you hereby irrevocably agree to waive any profit that you would otherwise have been entitled to receive on the Deferred Payment Date."

The parties  irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Committee for Settlement of Banking Disputes in case of any dispute arising in connection with any Transaction and the Agreement.\n\n4.4\tYou are encouraged to articulate complaints you might encounter with our product and services at any time.
